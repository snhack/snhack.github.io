The Hackspace itself is located at the [Museum of Computing]([view map]), and shares it's
location with the classroom that's used for computing courses such as [BBC First Click],
the [Children's Computer Club], and various other endeavours. Therefore, as well as a
general workbench area, we also have a dedicated computing space.

[Children's Computer Club]: http://museumofcomputing.org.uk/component/content/article/32-education-learning/91-ccc

Access is down stairs[^stairs] from the museum floor. We have WiFi Internet access and
computers available to use, but please bring your own laptop if you have one. Tea and
coffee making facilities are provided (as well as the tea and coffee).

We are conveniently located in the [town centre][view map], next to the Regent Circus bus
stops[^busstops] (northbound). Limited free parking can normally be found on
[Euclid Street], while the [Wyvern Car Park] costs £1.00 for upto two hours, or £2 all night (both after 6pm).

[^stairs]:
    Unfortunately, there's no wheelchair access to the hackspace; though it is
    still possible to visit the museum space upstairs. If you'd like to attend a
    particular event or class, please let us know in advance and we'll try to sort
    something out.

[^busstops]:
    Route numbers for nearby bus stops are shown on [this map][view map] (zoom
    in to see all three). Most local routes either pass through here, or within
    a 5 minute walk.

### In Development

- PCB making facilities - we have a UV light box and a [pen plotter] being
  modded to plot using an etch resist pen.

- [3D printer] - we are always doing upgrades to the printer, trying to
  improve the print quality, but do manage to get some printing time in-between.
