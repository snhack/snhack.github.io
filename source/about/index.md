The Swindon [Hackspace] formed in June 2012, holding [weekly meetings](#weekly-meetings)
for those interested in making, breaking, and fixing things. We are always looking to build membership and grow [our toolkit].

[Hackspace]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace
[our toolkit]: {{ site.github_wiki }}/Tools-and-consumables
[projects]: {{ site.github_wiki }}/Hackspace-Projects

Members work on a range of [projects] that usually involve electronic hardware, software
programming, and mechanical assembly. Popular projects often include prototyping
electronic circuits using breadboard, and interfacing with [Arduino], [Raspberry Pi] or
[Stellaris LaunchPad] microcontrollers.

Members occasionally run informal sessions on topics such as [PICAXE], Laser Cutting,
[OpenSCAD], and 3D Printing. If you have an idea for a session you would like to run,
please let us know via the [group] or on twitter [@snhack].

### Weekly Meetings

The Swindon Hackspace meets weekly at the [Museum of Computing], located near the Wyvern
Theatre ([view map]) and next to the Regent Circus bus stops[^busstops] (northbound).

Sessions start at 6.30pm each Wednesday and run until 10pm-11pm. Visitors are strongly
encouraged to bring along works in progress, new and interesting hardware, or any other
projects or shiny gadgets. There is a doorbell to ring later in the evening when nobody
is on the reception desk.

Session price is £4 and paid on admission. Membership is paid annually in advance
and costs £10 (waived until third visit for new members, due each July thereafter).

Limited free parking can normally be found on [Euclid Street], while the [Wyvern Car Park]
costs £1.00 for upto two hours, or £2 all night (both after 6pm).

Internet access is available via WiFi and Ethernet, we also have computers available if
required.


[^busstops]:
    Route numbers for nearby bus stops are shown on [this map][view map] (zoom
    in to see all three). Most local routes either pass through here, or within
    a 5 minute walk.
