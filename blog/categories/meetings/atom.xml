    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Quite a busy night at the Swindon Hackspace tonight. Welcome to the five(!) new people who turned up to see what we get up to at our weekly meetings, hope you had an enjoyable evening and we’ll see you again next week. Along with the regulars it made for a pretty full room. After resetting a few trip switches to sort out some power issues the evening got underway with a bit of chat about what we do, complimented by drinks and some biscuits brought in by a couple of our regulars, James and Jess.</p>

<p>James and Jess also turned up with some funky little electronic Cube World games, so we all spent a while trying to work out what they do. As far as we managed to work out, each cube contains a little character who you can control and play a simple game with. Clip the cubes together and the characters will move between the cubes and interact with each other. Information on the internet seems sparse, even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radica_Games">Wikipedia</a>  doesn’t appear to have a page. There is a <a href="http://service.mattel.com/instruction_sheets/i6063.pdf">manual</a> available for download from the Mattel website and plenty for sale on <a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_nkw=mattel+cube+world+series">ebay</a> if you fancy getting some.</p>

<p>In the mean-time people rummaged through the selection of 3D printed items Steve had brought in and he chatted with some of the newcomers about 3D printing showing off some of his excellent 3D prints and designs.</p>

<p>Simon brought in the <a href="http://robosavvy.com/store/product_info.php/products_id/1206?osCsid=31b1a0e3c1d9c27c6c802d752bd477c5">robot arm</a> he’d recently bought for the <a href="http://www.museumofcomputing.org.uk/">Swindon Museum of Computing</a> <a href="http://www.museumofcomputing.org.uk/exhibitions/2-current-exhibitions/108-robots-revealed">robots revealed exhibition</a>.  He was having some trouble getting it to work reliably. After a some messing around we discovered that powering the servos from 6V rather than 5V resolved the problem. There is a short video of it in action on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEHG0bBv5ys">YouTube</a></p>

<p>The hackspace has recently been working on getting an old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HERO_(robot)">Heathkit Hero</a> robot to work (but we’ve not been making much progress recently in all honesty!)  One of the members has 3D printed some replacement parts for the arm and we need to replace some of the wiring inside after it was, er, accidentally shorted out during some testing.  It has been commandeered back into the museum for the robot exhibition so we spent a bit of time refitting its outer panels and reattaching the repaired arm ready for display.</p>

<p>As a few members headed off home leaving the die-hards, James set up the oscilloscope to have a poke around in his Blu-ray player with the hope of doing some hacking on it and we pondered the issues we’ve been having with the internet connection recently.</p>

<p>All in all a fairly busy and entertaining evening. Sorry if I’ve missed off anything else that people were doing but there way too much going on to see and hear everything.</p>

<p>Rob.</p>

    <updated>2013-06-28T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://swindon.hackspace.org.uk/blog/gyrobot-resurrection</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Gyrobot was made available to the <a href="http://www.museum-of-computing.org.uk/" title="http://www.museum-of-computing.org.uk/">Swindon Museum of Computing</a> on Hackspace night; 19th June 2013 for their upcoming <a href="http://www.museumofcomputing.org.uk/exhibitions/2-current-exhibitions/108-robots-revealed" title="http://www.museumofcomputing.org.uk/exhibitions/2-current-exhibitions/108-robots-revealed">Robots Revealed</a> exhibition.</p>

<p>For those that are not familiar with Gyrobot, it was my (Steve Wood) entry into the UK Robot Wars series 6 and 7, back in 2002.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Gyrobot originally started its journey in 2000 with myself, a Robot Wars fan deciding to design and build a Swindon entry for the UK version of Robot Wars. 3 years later and after 1 failed audition, it appeared on Series 7 which was filmed in Nottingham August 2003 and screened in November.</p>

<p><img src="gyrobot.jpg" alt="Gyrobot" /></p>

<p>This entry was named Gyrobot from the word Gyrate which is to spin/revolve and to rotate in circles, and erm - robot! Also “Gyro” is short for gyroscope, a device that spins. I have now affectionately adopted this name for many of my online avatars, my design and 3D printing company is unashamedly named after it too (<a href="http://www.gyrobot.co.uk" title="http://www.gyrobot.co.uk">Gyrobot Ltd</a>).</p>

<h2 id="interesting-facts-about-gyrobot-">Interesting Facts About Gyrobot :</h2>

<ol>
  <li>I believe Gyrobot is the smallest heavyweight in the world (100kg category). Challenge this fact if you can. Dia 700mm x 150mm.</li>
  <li>Gyrobot has no interior orientation, top can be bottom and bottom can be top, a truly symmetrical robot in all directions.</li>
  <li>Gyrobot has no weak side, all angles of opponents attack are catered for.</li>
  <li>Gyrobot’s best form of attack is it’s defence. To get near it be prepared to get damaged!!</li>
  <li>The energy stored in Gyrobot’s 35 kg outer weapon rim when up to full speed (750 RPM) is 40KJoules (Validated by two independent sources). Compare that with current Hypnodisc’s 12KJoules. Energy is even higher when Gyrobot is in full body spin mode.</li>
</ol>

<p>Either come along to the <a href="/about/#weekly-meetings" title="http://swindon.hackspace.org.uk/about/">Swindon Hackspace</a> on a Wednesday night or the <a href="http://www.museumofcomputing.org.uk/exhibitions/2-current-exhibitions/108-robots-revealed" title="http://www.museumofcomputing.org.uk/exhibitions/2-current-exhibitions/108-robots-revealed">Robots Revealed</a> exhibition at the <a href="http://www.museum-of-computing.org.uk/" title="http://www.museum-of-computing.org.uk/">Swindon Museum of Computing</a> for the next 6 months to have a closer look, but please - not available to hack, one false move and it bites back hard ;-)</p>

    <link href="http://swindon.hackspace.org.uk/blog/first-year-anniversary-meet-up/"/>

    <id>http://swindon.hackspace.org.uk/blog/first-year-anniversary-meet-up</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On June 5th we celebrated our 1st year anniversary. Rather than attend a usual meet we decided to relocate the Hackspace to the more informal surroundings of the <a href="http://swindonhistory.blogspot.co.uk/2011/12/sir-daniel-arms.html" title="http://swindonhistory.blogspot.co.uk/2011/12/sir-daniel-arms.html">Sir Daniel Arms</a> for a bite to eat and some drinks:</p>

<p>We met at the <a href="http://www.museum-of-computing.org.uk/" title="http://www.museum-of-computing.org.uk/">Museum of Computing</a> between 6:30 and 7pm, left a map to the pub for any late shows before taking the short walk down town. An unusual collection of reprobates we must have looked, but soon realising that we actually fitted in quite well with the other townsfolk. It’s cool not to be cool I always tell my kids.

<p>When we arrived at the pub, it was surprisingly busy, with all the tables seemingly taken. However we soon flexed our substantial muscles and hacked together a collection of smaller seats, stools, loungers to make some sort of makeshift eating area.</p>

<p><strong>Our simple pub review:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Beer was great, prices were very cheap, food was ‘fine’, bartender girl was the most miserable ever, waitress however was nice and chatty.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those lucky attendees who turned up were rewarded with a hot off the printbed Swindon Hackspace multi-coloured poker chip, worth 1 Gigillion credits, accepted in no respectable establishments worldwide. Even the waitress was curious as to what it was, “a badge of shame” she was told, only surpassed by McDonald’s zero stars:-</p>

<p><img src="3D Prints.jpg" alt="Sneak preview of the new Swindon Hackspace Logo" /></p>

<p>Tony showed a collection of prints from his new Replicator 3D printer. Looking forward to seeing some more.</p>

<p>Conversation was good, many subjects covered and not all hackey. We sort of flirted with the following ideas, but nothing as usual in concrete:-</p>

<ul>
  <li>Collaborative Hackspace projects (3D printer).</li>
  <li>Visit to Bristol and possibly Oxford Hackspaces.</li>
  <li>Contact first timers for feedback.</li>
  <li>Another publicity drive.</li>
  <li>Some web site glitches which need to be discussed with Jamie.</li>
  <li>Increased blog activity, which is why I was volunteered for this entry ;-)</li>
</ul>

<p>Which leads me to signing off this entry with a congratulations to hackspace members on achieving our paper anniversary.</p>
